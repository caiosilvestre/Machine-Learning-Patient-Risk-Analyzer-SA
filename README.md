# About this repository
Machine Learning Patient Risk Analyzer Solution Accelerator is an end-to-end (E2E) healthcare app that leverages ML prediction models (e.g., Diabetes Mellitus (DM) patient 30-day re-admission, breast cancer risk, etc.) to demonstrate how these models can provide key insights for both physicians and patients.  Patients can easily access their appointment and care history with infused cognitive services through a conversational interface.

In addition to providing new insights for both doctors and patients, the app also provides the Data Scientist/IT Specialist with one-click experiences for registering and deploying a new or existing model to Azure Kubernetes Clusters, and best practices for maintaining these models through Azure MLOps.

## Prerequisites
In order to successfully complete this solution accelerator, you will need to have access to and/or provisioned the following resources:

1. Access to an [Azure Subscription ](http://portal.azure.com)
2. [Power Apps](http://www.powerapps.com) License (or free trial)
3. [PowerShell 7.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-7.1)
4. [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
5. [Docker Desktop](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) - Required for Debugging in local or containerizing codes in the Deployment process

## Architecture Overview
The architecture diagram below details what you will be building for this Solution Accelerator.

![Architecture Diagram](./Resource_Deployment/img/ReferenceArchitecture.png)

## Azure Development and Analytics Platforms
The directions provided for this repository assume fundemental working knowledge of Azure, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Machine Learning and Azure Cognitive Services
1. [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/)
2. [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/synapse-analytics/)
3. [Azure Cognitive Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/)
4. [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/)
5. [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db)
6. [Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/)
7. [Power Virtual Agent](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/)


## Getting Started
Start by deploying the [resources](./Resource_Deployment/ResourceDeployment.md) needed for this solution,

1. Press Deploy Azure :

    [![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FMachine-Learning-Patient-Risk-Analyzer-SA%2Fmain%2FResource_Deployment%2Fazuredeploy.json)

2. Clone repository and navigate to the root of the directory
3. Go to [Deployment Guide](./Resource_Deployment/README.md) under [./Resource_Deployment](./Resource_Deployment) for the steps you need to take to deploy this solution

## Folders
## [Resource Deployment](./Resource_Deployment/README.md)
The resources in this folder can be used to deploy the required resources into your Azure Subscription. You can do this in the Azure Portal

## [Analytics Deployment](./Analytics_Deployment)
This folder contains the Notebooks needed to complete this solution accelerator. Once you have deployed all the required resources from [Resource Deployment](./Resource_Deployment/README.md), run through the Notebooks following the instructions in Resource Deployment.

## [Backend Deployment](./Backend_Deployment)
This folder contains all API services consumed via Power Automate.
As Architecture diagram shows all of services will be compiled and deployed in Azure Kuebernetes service with [deployment script](./Backend_Deployment/deployapplications.ps1)

## [Frontend Deployment](./Frontend_Deployment)
This folder contains Dialog based Patient User Interface Applications(Power Virtual Agent) and related services.
